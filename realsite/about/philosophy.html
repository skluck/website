	<h1>Programming Philosophy</h1>

	<h2>Unix</h2>
	<p>
	Do one thing, and do it well. <br>
	Transact and interface with plain text. <br>
	Enforce modularity. <br>
	Pipes are good. <br>
	<a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/mdmpipe.html">Advice from Doug Mcilroy.</a> <br>
	<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/">The Art of Unix Programming by Eric Raymond.</a>
	</p>

	<h2>Windows</h2>
	<p>
	The WIN API is designed to be abused. <br>
	Always statically link. Wasted space is better than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLL_Hell">DLL hell</a>. <br>
	Run everything in user mode. Even drivers.
	</p>

	<h2>Programming</h2>
	<p>
	Use the right language for the job. <br>
	Python is never the right language for the job. <br>
	PHP is also never the right language for the job. <br>
	Faster is better than slower. <br>
	Don't reinvent the wheel, unless you want to. <br>
	</p>

	<h2>Web Development and Design</h2>
	<p>
	<a href="https://www.princeton.edu/~achaney/tmve/wiki100k/docs/KISS_principle.html">Keep it simple, stupid.</a><br>
	It's not going to render correctly anways. <br>
	CGI and nginx do not mix. Just look at this website.
	</p>

	<h2>Software, Freedom, and Privacy</h2>
	<p>
	Software should conform to the design philosophy of the system it executes on. <br>
	Open Source is better than Closed Source, but intellectual property is important. <br>
	"Free Software" should be free as in free beer, and free as in freedom. <br>
	Open Source should be permissive - it is open, isn't it? <br>
	The GPL isn't permissive. The MIT License is (with caveats). <br>
	Software should respect the privacy of its users. That includes websites. <br>
	</p>

	<!--
	<h2>Hacking</h2>
	<p>
	<a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/online-preface.html">The Jargon File covers this.</a> <br>
	It's become popular to call things that aren't actually hacking "hacking." <br>
	Writing shiny web 2.0 websites with modern frameworks and JavaScript is not hacking. <br>
