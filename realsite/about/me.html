	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>
	Hi. <br>
	My name is William. <br>
	I'm an aspiring computer scientist. <br>
	I'm especially interested in systems design and security, which I hope to pursue in college. <br>
	Towards that end, I've endeavoured to teach myself more about computers and the ways in which we interact with them. <br>
	I've taught myself a number of (computer) languages, and have applied their abilities to a number of projects on this website. <br>
	I leave them for you to judge. <br>
	Additionally, here is my <a href="/realsite/files/resume/resume.pdf">resume</a>.
