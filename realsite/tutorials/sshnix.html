	<h1>Instructions for using the Secure Shell (SSH) on Unix and Unix-like OSes</h1>

	<h2>What You'll Need</h2>
	<ul>
	<li>A fully or reasonably POSIX compliant OS. This includes *BSD, Linux, OS X, Solaris, and Cygwin on Windows.</li>
	<li>OpenSSH or another implementation of SSH. This is almost always already installed. If it isn't, use your package manager to install it.</li>
	<li>A valid username and password for the server you're connecting to.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Instructions</h2>
	<p>
	First, open up your terminal emulator. On OS X, this is an application called "Terminal." <br> On other Unix-like OSes, this can be xterm, rxvt, or any other user-installer terminal emulator. <br>
	You should be greeted by something similar to this:
	</p>

	<p>
	The terminal has a number of incredibly useful functions and utilities, but we'll be focusing on the `ssh' utility, which provides full terminal access to a remote system. <br>
	To begin, type `ssh' followed by your username and the remote system's IP or hostname. <br>
	The format of this section is exactly like an e-mail address:
	</p>

	<p>
	Press return, and you should receive some kind of warning regarding the server not being recognized. <br>
	This is because new connections do not have the target server's key stored. <br>
	Answer yes to this, and your computer will cache a unique key for future connections. <br>
	Press return, and you should be prompted for a password:
	</p>

	<img src="/realsite/res/imgs/tutorials/sshnix/terminalpass.png" alt="SSH password">

	<p>
	Enter your password carefully, as most terminals do not echo input in secure fields (like passwords). <br>
	Press return. <br>
	Congratulations! You're now SSHed into a remote host!
	</p>

	<h2>Now What?</h2>
	<p>
	Because an SSH session on a remote host is virtually identical to a physical terminal session on a local host, you have access to many, all, or even more of the commands you had on your physical host. <br>
	Provided the environment is POSIX or POSIX-like, you should feel right at home. <br>
	If you have any questions, don't be afraid to message another user with "talk" or to send out a systemwide request with "wall".
