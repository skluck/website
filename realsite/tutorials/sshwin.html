	<h1>Instructions for using the Secure Shell (SSH) on Windows</h1>

	<h2>What You'll Need</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html">PuTTY - The simple and lightweight terminal emulator and SSH/Telnet client.</a></li>
		<li>A valid username and password for the server you're connecting to.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Instructions</h2>
	<p>
	First, open up PuTTY. You should be greeted by an interface that looks something like this:
	</p>

	<p>
	Enter the IP address or hostname of the server you want to connect to. <br>
	Make sure that the "Connection type" matches your connection. <br>
	Once you have entered this information, click "Open". If this is your first time connection, the following should pop up:
	</p>

	<img src="/realsite/res/imgs/tutorials/sshwin/puttywarning.png" alt="PuTTY Warning">

	<p>
	This is just a warning explaining the dangers of connecting to a previously unknown server. <br>
	By clicking "yes," you tell PuTTY to cache your connection's RSA2 key for later use. <br>
	Press "yes" and you should arrive at this screen:
	</p>

	<img src="/realsite/res/imgs/tutorials/sshwin/puttylogin.png" alt="PuTTY Login">

	<p>
	This is the login prompt, or the last step between you and actual access to the system. <br>
	First, you must enter your username. Press return (enter), and you should be prompted for a password: <br>
	</p>

	<img src="/realsite/res/imgs/tutorials/sshwin/puttypass.png" alt="PuTTY Password">

	<p>
	Enter your password. Don't be afraid when you don't see any text appear on the screen. <br>
	When dealing with passwords and other secure data, the terminal standard is to hide input completely. <br>
	Once you've entered your password, press return. Congratulations! You're now SSHed into a server!
	</p>

	<h2>Now What?</h2>
	<p>
	Now that you're actually connected to the server via SSH, you can go about your business. <br>
	If you're completely new to terminal interaction, here are a few useful key combinations:
	<ul>
		<li>ls - list the contents of a directory</li>
		<li>cd [directory] - change the current directory (the one you're in) to the one specified</li>
		<li>mkdir [name] - make a new directory with the given name</li>
		<li>touch [name] - make a new file with the given name</li>
		<li>Ctrl-C - interrupt the current program or process (this is useful for stopping runaway processes)</li>
		<li>Ctrl-D - kill the current program or process (a more powerful Ctrl-C, use sparingly)</li>
		<li>who - see who else is online (i.e. connected to the server)</li>
		<li>talk [user] - message a user through talkd (the talk daemon). Very useful for asking for advice or help.</li>
		<li>wall [message] - send out a system-wide broadcast of a message.</li>
	</ul>
	Furthermore, because the SSH environment you're now working in is very likely a Unix or Unix-like one, you can now use the `ssh' command to nest into even more SSH sessions! <br>
	For more information on this, see the page on SSH instructions for *nix.
