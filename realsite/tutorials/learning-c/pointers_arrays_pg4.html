	<h4 class="subheading"><em>Fun fact: array notation in C is actually just syntactic sugar for pointer notation.</em></h4>

	<h2>Pointers</h2>
	<p>
	As mentioned in the last section, a pointer in C holds the address in RAM of a specific variable. For example:
	<pre><code>
		int i = 5;
		int *i_pointer = &amp;i;
	</code></pre>
	In this example, <code>i_pointer</code> now contains the location in memory of <code>i</code>, or 5. The ampersand is used to express the "address of" a variable. <br>
	Now, pointers may not seem very useful at first. However, they are the only way to <em>pass by reference</em> in C. <br>
	This can be incredibly useful in input functions like <code>scanf</code>:
	<pre><code>
		int a = 0, b = 0, c = 0;
		int *ap = &amp;a, *bp = &amp;b, *cp = &amp;c;

		scanf("%d %d %d", &amp;a, &amp;b, &amp;c);
		scanf("%d %d %d", ap, bp, cp);
	</code></pre>
	It's very important to understand that the two <code>scanf</code> calls in the code above do the <strong>exact same thing</strong>. In fact, the second call will overwrite the variables stored by the first call. <br>
	The only difference is how the variables are accessed and stored. One uses direct "address of" notation to skip declaring pointer variables, while the other explictly declares a pointer to each variable to be scanned into.
	These pointers can then be accessed by <em>dereferencing</em>:
	<pre><code>
		printf("%d %d %d\n", a, b, c);
		printf("%d %d %d\n", *ap, *bp, *cp);
	</code></pre>
	Again, these two calls do the <strong>exact same thing</strong>, but through different processes. Because ap, bp, and cp are pointers, they cannot be printed out as decimals (Well, they can, but something weird will happen. Try it out.)
	They must be <em>dereferenced</em>, which is to say that the data stored they point to must be accessed.
