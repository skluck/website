	<h1>Page 1: Introduction</h1>

	<h2>Why C?</h2>
	<p>
	As one of the world's first high-level languages, C plays a vital role in virtually every operating system. <br>
	Thanks to its combined high-level syntax and low-level facilities, C remains one of the world's most popular languages, <br>  enjoying usage in every area of programming. <br>
	C is especially important in systems programming and hardware interfacing, making it a must-know for aspiring systems developers. <br>
	This tutorials will introduce you to the syntax of C (C89 and C99), and will allow you to approach and solve your own problems through C.
	</p>

	<h2>Who is this guide for?</h2>
	<p>
	This guide is primarily intended for programmers and developers with experience in other languages. <br>
	A background in ALGOL-like languages (Java, C++, Perl, etc) may make it easier to understand C's syntax and follow this guide. <br>
	If you don't have any prior experience with programming, you'll probably find it easier to read a book on the subject. <br>
	</p>

	<h2>What is C for?</h2>
	<p>
	Although C is incredibly powerful, it's not for everything. <br>
	Its relatively small standard library and memory footprint make it ideal for high-performance computing, but also force the programmer to "reinvent the wheel." <br>
	When development time matters more than execution time, other languages like Java, Perl, and bash should be considered for their more expansive facilities. <br> 
	</p>

	<h2>Requirements</h2>
	<p>
	To follow this guide, you're going to need several programs installed on your computer: <br>
	<ul>
		<li>A C compiler like gcc, clang, tcc, or msvc.</li>
		<li>A text editor (or IDE) like vi(m), emacs, Sublime Text, or Notepad(++). Syntax highlighting is a major plus.</li>
		<li><strong>Recommended: </strong>A Unix or Unix-like operating system like OS X, Linux, or BSD. On Windows, Cygwin/MinGW is <strong>strongly</strong> recommended.</li>
	</ul>
