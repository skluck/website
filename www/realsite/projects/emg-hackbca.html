	<h2>Status: Hackathoned</h2>

	<p>
	Receives data and writes data from an Olimex EMG/EKG shield on an Arduino Uno, using said data in a varity of proof-of-concept programs. <br>
	Developed during the HackBCA high schooler hackathon at Bergen County Academy in Hackensack, NJ. <br>
	Interfacing is performed via an Arduino Wiring program based upon Olimex samples, while the PoC programs are written from scratch in Processing. <br>
