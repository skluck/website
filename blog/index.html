                    <h4>Date: Sometime in late 2013, early 2014</h4>

                    <h3>What You'll Need</h3>
                    <ul>
                    	<li><a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html">PuTTY - The simple and lightweight terminal emulator and SSH/Telnet client.</a></li>
                    	<li>A valid username and password for the server you're connecting to.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Instructions</h4>
                    <p>
                    First, open up PuTTY. You should be greeted by an interface that looks something like this:
                    </p>

                    <img src="/realsite/res/imgs/tutorials/sshwin/putty.png" alt="PuTTY Configuration">

                    <p>
                    Enter the IP address or hostname of the server you want to connect to. <br>
                    Make sure that the "Connection type" matches your connection. <br>
                    Once you have entered this information, click "Open". If this is your first time connection, the following should pop up:
                    </p>

                    <img src="/realsite/res/imgs/tutorials/sshwin/puttywarning.png" alt="PuTTY Warning">

                    <p>
                    This is just a warning explaining the dangers of connecting to a previously unknown server. <br>
                    By clicking "yes," you tell PuTTY to cache your connection's RSA2 key for later use. <br>
                    Press "yes" and you should arrive at this screen:
                    </p>

                    <img src="/realsite/res/imgs/tutorials/sshwin/puttylogin.png" alt="PuTTY Login">

                    <p>
                    This is the login prompt, or the last step between you and actual access to the system. <br>
                    First, you must enter your username. Press return (enter), and you should be prompted for a password: <br>
                    </p>

                    <img src="/realsite/res/imgs/tutorials/sshwin/puttypass.png" alt="PuTTY Password">

                    <p>
                    Enter your password. Don't be afraid when you don't see any text appear on the screen. <br>
                    When dealing with passwords and other secure data, the terminal standard is to hide input completely. <br>
                    Once you've entered your password, press return. Congratulations! You're now SSHed into a server!
                    </p>

                    <img src="/realsite/res/imgs/tutorials/sshwin/puttycongrats.png" alt="PuTTY Congratulations">

                    <h4>Now What?</h4>
                    <p>
                    Now that you're actually connected to the server via SSH, you can go about your business. <br>
                    If you're completely new to terminal interaction, here are a few useful key combinations:
                    <ul>
                    	<li><code>ls</code> - list the contents of a directory</li>
                    	<li><code>cd [directory]</code> - change the current directory (the one you're in) to the one specified</li>
                    	<li><code>mkdir [name]</code> - make a new directory with the given name</li>
                    	<li><code>touch [name]</code> - make a new file with the given name</li>
                    	<li><code>Ctrl-C</code> - interrupt the current program or process (this is useful for stopping runaway processes)</li>
                    	<li><code>Ctrl-D</code> - kill the current program or process (a more powerful Ctrl-C, use sparingly)</li>
                    	<li><code>who</code> - see who else is online (i.e. connected to the server)</li>
                    	<li><code>talk [user]</code> - message a user through talkd (the talk daemon). Very useful for asking for advice or help.</li>
                    	<li><code>wall [message]</code> - send out a system-wide broadcast of a message.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Furthermore, because the SSH environment you're now working in is very likely a Unix or Unix-like one, you can now use the `ssh' command to nest into even more SSH sessions! <br>
                    For more information on this, see the page on SSH instructions for *nix.
