            		<h2>Archive 2: A guide to the Secure Shell (SSH) on *nix.</h2>

                	<h3>What You'll Need</h3>
                	<ul>
                	<li>A fully or reasonably POSIX compliant OS. This includes *BSD, Linux, OS X, Solaris, and Cygwin on Windows.</li>
                	<li>OpenSSH or another implementation of SSH. This is almost always already installed. If it isn't, one can be installed easily via your package manager.</li>
                	<li>A valid username and password for the server you're connecting to.</li>
                	</ul>

                	<h3>Instructions</h3>
                	<p>
                	First, open up your terminal emulator. On OS X, this is an application called "Terminal." <br> On other Unix-like OSes, this can be xterm, rxvt, or any other user-installer terminal emulator. <br>
                	You should be greeted by something similar to this:
                	</p>

                	<img src="/realsite/res/imgs/tutorials/sshnix/terminal.png" alt="A Terminal">

                	<p>
                	The terminal has a number of incredibly useful functions and utilities, but we'll be focusing on the `ssh' utility, which provides full terminal access to a remote system. <br>
                	To begin, type `ssh' followed by your username and the remote system's IP or hostname. <br>
                	The format of this section is exactly like an e-mail address:
                	</p>

                	<img src="/realsite/res/imgs/tutorials/sshnix/terminallogin.png" alt="SSH Login">

                	<p>
                	Press return, and you should receive some kind of warning regarding the server not being recognized. <br>
                	This is because new connections do not have the target server's key stored. <br>
                	Answer yes to this, and your computer will cache a unique key for future connections. <br>
                	Press return, and you should be prompted for a password:
                	</p>

                	<img src="/realsite/res/imgs/tutorials/sshnix/terminalpass.png" alt="SSH password">

                	<p>
                	Enter your password carefully, as most terminals do not echo input in secure fields (like passwords). <br>
                	Press return. <br>
                	Congratulations! You're now SSHed into a remote host!
                	</p>

                	<img src="/realsite/res/imgs/tutorials/sshnix/terminalcongrats.png" alt="Terminal Congratulations">

                	<h3>Now What?</h3>
                	<p>
                	Because an SSH session on a remote host is virtually identical to a physical terminal session on a local host, you have access to many, all, or even more of the commands you had on your physical host. <br>
                	Provided the environment is POSIX or POSIX-like, you should feel right at home. <br>
                	If you have any questions, don't be afraid to message another user with <code>talk</code> or to send out a systemwide request with <code>wall</code>. 
                	</p>
